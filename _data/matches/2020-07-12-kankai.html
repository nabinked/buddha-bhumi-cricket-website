What a nail biter of a finish.
Batting first GBBCC started off pretty strong with the opening pairs making 61 together allowing the team to reach 100 runs
within 11 overs but the match turned a complete U-turn when Kankai bowlers made a strong comeback the next half of 
the innings bowling rest of the batsmen within 19 overs and only allowing GBCC to make 139 in total. Chasing an competent total, 
GBB bowlers gave early breakthroughs (which included a broken stump, more on that in the next post), 
and the momentum kept swinging back and forth between the two teams. The match went down to the wire and Kankai
almost snatched the match away from GBB when they made 13 runs off the last over but fell short by 5 runs to win the match. 
Overall a great day of cricket. Goldstar Shoes Australia gave away $15 free gift vouchers to Sampraz and Bibek from 
Kankai for their outstanding performance in bowling and batting.
