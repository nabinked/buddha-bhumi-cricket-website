Loosing the toss, GBBCC were put on to bowl first and Rupesh, our swing maestro gave us a dream start with 2 wickets in 
the first two balls of the match and finishing the over maiden and then came Razu our pace maestro who struck another one 
giving us 3 wickets in the first two overs. Although it looked like we were about to wrap Kankai up quite easily 
but they were not done with the fight and their lower middle order kept on pushing and helped them to put a target of 70 runs.
GBBCC, after getting a dream start with the ball, also got another dream start, this time with the bat, as Suman and Nishant 
started raining boundaries all across the ground and the openers alone took the game away from Kanakai within 6 overs and 
GBBCC won the match with all 10 wickets in hand. Go Goldstar ! Jay Buddha Bhumi ! 👏👏
