Winning the toss and batting first, NAYA went off to a cracking start smashing 50 runs within 5 overs. 
Things were looking a bit dim for GBBCC but not for too long as Razu gave the needed break through and some quick 
wickets from the spin maestro Nabin Kc helped GBBCC put a hold on the run machine and stopped the opposition to 
only score another 30 runs in the next 5 overs which has been the story of us so far with 2nd half comebacks.
Chasing a respectable target of 81, GBBCC also went off to a cracking start with the openers doing their job in a fine 
manner and the middle order batsmen chipping in with double digit scores to win the match and head to the final against 
Kankai Nepalese CC who took a last over thriller away from Mt.8848 CC in their first match.
